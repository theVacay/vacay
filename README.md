## Vacay

![alt tag](https://github.com/theVacay/vacay/blob/master/doc/homepage.png?raw=true)

Vacay is a web application created by Information and Computer Science (ICS) students from [University of Hawaii at Manoa](https://www.hawaii.edu).  We were tasked to demonstrate our understanding of a responsive web site by using the skills we have developed throughout a web programming course.

The following application is run through [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform built to design and create websites with ease.  Within two weeks, we have created a website that implements many databases that holds reservations for the user such as: flights, hotels, car rentals, and other activities.

## Usage

Cd into the app directory and run the application:

```
% meteor --settings ../config/settings.development.json
```

If all goes well, the template application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  You can login using the credentials in [settings.development.json](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template/blob/master/config/settings.development.json), or else register a new account.
